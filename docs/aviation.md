# Aviation Safety Reviewer (`/aviation`)

**Independent second opinion on aircraft type-certification changes.** The agent reads a live FAA Airworthiness Directive and emits FILED or REFUSED with a written critique.

## Failure shape

Boeing 737 MAX MCAS, 2018–2019, 346 deaths. The certification process trusted the manufacturer's framing of the system change. An independent reviewer with access to the underlying engineering memos — and an explicit job description of "find the failure mode the OEM didn't disclose" — would have refused to file.

## What the agent reads

- Live FAA Airworthiness Directives via the Federal Register API (`federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents.json?agencies=federal-aviation-administration&type=RULE`)
- Filtered to titles containing "airworthiness directive"
- Aircraft family extracted from the post-semicolon phrase in the AD title

## Decision

FILED (green) or REFUSED (red). The agent's role is the independent reviewer — its written rationale is the part that matters more than the binary verdict.
