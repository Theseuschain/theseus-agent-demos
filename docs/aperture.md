# Aperture 0312 (`/aperture`)

**Agentic NFT — generative visual artist.** Mint-locked palette and composition rules; refusals are signed.

## What this proves

The signed-refusal is the part worth noticing. A generative artist that produces on demand for any commission has nothing to defend. One whose contract hash binds the palette + composition + refusal criteria, and whose REFUSED commissions are written to chain with reasons, has a coherent identity over time.

## What's on-chain

- Immutable `fingerprintHash` (bytes32) — keccak256 of the canonical fingerprint (palette HSL tuples + structural rules + refusal set). Preimage in [contracts/deployments/base-sepolia.md](../contracts/deployments/base-sepolia.md).
- Per-commission `PUBLISHED` / `REFUSED` events with `reasonHash`.

## Try it

[demo-agents.theseus.network/aperture](https://demo-agents.theseus.network/aperture). Submit a commission brief; the agent either generates or signs a refusal explaining which rule the brief violated.

## On-chain

Commissions go to [ApertureArtist](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xA10BAbeE86c1f1838891c549d63c49697620F98A).
