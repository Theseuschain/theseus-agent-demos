# Marcellus (`/marcellus`)

**AI persona — music critic.** Signed canon, closed lexicon, refuses paid coverage on the record.

## What this proves

A critic with no integrity surface signs nothing and accepts anything. Marcellus's persona hash binds the canon (six records the critic considers load-bearing), the closed lexicon (words the critic refuses to use: "vibe," "literally," "redefines"), and the refusal criteria (label-paid coverage, active litigation, unreleased material, anything outside the critic's stated engagement window).

## What the agent reads

- Live Pitchfork releases via the canonical RSS (`/feed/rss`), filtered to "Reviews / Albums"
- Artist + album extracted from the URL slug + title
- Synthetic preset releases reproducing edge cases (label-paid, lawsuit-pending, etc.)

## Decision

FILED (the review goes on the record) or REFUSED (with reason). FILED reviews are written to chain with a `reasonHash` pointing at the full blob.

## Persona preimage (committed at deploy)
