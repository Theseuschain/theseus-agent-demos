    "How agent-settled prediction markets resolve: the Theseus adjudicator reads the primary record and commits a verdict at 80%+ confidence, instead of a token vote a few holders can swing.",

const STEPS = [
  {
    n: "01",
    h: "Trade while the market is open",
    p: "Buy YES or NO shares with play-money USDC. Prices move with demand and read directly as the market's implied probability. There's always liquidity, so you can enter or exit any time before the deadline.",
  },
  {
    n: "02",
    h: "The deadline closes trading",
    p: "At the resolution date, trading stops. The market now needs a verdict, and that's where most prediction markets are weakest: the answer gets decided by whoever the oracle lets vote.",
  },
  {
    n: "03",
    h: "The agent reads the record",
    p: "A Theseus agent searches the sources named in the rules and weighs what it finds. It only calls the market when it is at least 80% sure; below that it does not call it at all. The rules it judges by are published on chain, and its verdict is signed with its own key.",
  },
  {
    n: "04",
    h: "Settlement pays the record",
    p: "Each share of the winning outcome pays $1; the other side pays $0. If the record is too thin or too split to clear the bar, the agent returns UNRESOLVABLE and every position is refunded its cost. No forced payout on a coin flip.",

const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "How is this different from Polymarket?",
    a: "The trading is the same. The resolution is different. Polymarket's disputed markets are settled by a UMA token vote, so whoever holds the most tokens can move the answer. Three 2025–2026 disputes worth about $298M were settled on the wrong outcome that way. Here, resolution comes from an agent reading the primary record, which no token balance can outvote.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know the agent is fair?",
    a: "It publishes its verbatim system prompt on chain, so anyone can read the exact rules it judges by before a market resolves. Every settlement shows the evidence summary and the source links it used, and the run is signed by the agent's on-chain key. You can verify exactly how each verdict was reached.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the price be manipulated by a whale?",
    a: "The price is just the market's belief, and buying it up only moves the price, not the payout. Settlement is decided by the record, so cornering a market changes nothing about how it resolves. That's the opposite of a token-vote oracle, where buying votes can buy the outcome.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if the question can't be settled?",
    a: "The agent returns UNRESOLVABLE rather than guessing, and every position is refunded its cost. A wrong resolution pays a market out on the wrong truth and can't be undone; an honest UNRESOLVABLE just sends it to human dispute. The verdict and evidence are public, so a bad call is reviewable.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a share worth?",
    a: "Each share pays exactly $1 if its outcome is the agent's verdict, and $0 if it isn't. So a YES share bought at 62¢ returns 38¢ of profit if YES wins, or the cost if the market resolves UNRESOLVABLE.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this real money?",
    a: "No. Theseus Predict is a testnet demo. Balances are play-money USDC with no cash value, dispensed from a faucet. It exists to show the settlement mechanism end to end, not to take wagers.",

      </h1>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-fg-dim">
        A prediction market is only as good as the thing that settles it. Most
        hand that job to a token vote, which big holders can swing. Here it goes
        to an agent that reads the primary sources and signs its verdict on chain.

          The agent only calls a market when it is at least 80% sure the sources
          settle it. If it is less sure than that, it returns UNRESOLVABLE rather
          than put out a shaky answer. So when something here says &ldquo;resolved,&rdquo;
          the sources actually settled it. You can read the live verdicts on the{" "}
